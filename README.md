# Hex Viewer
Parse any document (HTML, CSS, tmTheme, etc) to extract all Hex values and then view the values and colors in a local server.

## Use Case
When modifying theme files, or trying to create a color palette from an existing css file, I often find myself needing a list of all of the hex values within a document. It's easy enough for me to search the document for a hex value, but sometimes I want to see the actual color outputs of those hex values. I've developed a node script that uses regular expressions to search for hex values and concurrently displays the colors.
